Buconica, aer. r. 62-77. 109

(as Keightley and Conington) have suggested Virgil's language heret but
such impassioned appeals for the reversal of nature's lawa sooner than that
something unlikely or undesirable should happen, rise naturally to the lips
of any orator or poet. Thus in Sir Walter Scott's ‘Lay of the Last
Minstrel,' Canto I, stanza xviii, the Ladye of Branksome
‘Raised her stately head
And her heart throbbed high with pride;
“Your mountains shall bend,
And your streams ascend,
Ere Margaret be our foeman's bridel'”

62. peremti· amborum finibus, ‘each wandering o’er the other's
bounds' The Arar (Sadne) is strictly speaking a river of Gaul: but it¹
rises in the Vosges, not far from Germany.

65. Atros, poetical accus. of motion towards: cp. Aen. vi. 696 haec limina
tendere adegit.

66. oaxen, apparently the river which flows by Axus or Oaxus, a town
in Crete, mentioned by Herodotus, iv. 154. For cretas some editors print
cretae, explaining rapidum cretae Oaxen as ‘the chalk·rolling Oaxes,’ i. e.
the Oxus, or Jihun, of Central Asia. They defend this interpretation on
the grounds (1) of want of evidence for a Cretan river Oaxes, (2) the appro-
priateness of the wilds of Asia to complete the picture suggested by Afros,
Scythiam, and Britannos, and (3) that the idea of‘chalk·rolling' agrees
with epithets elsewhere applied to the Oxus. But no change is really
necessary, and the use of rapidus with a genitive=rapax would be an
unparalleled construction.

67. nemine, ‘utterly' toto divinos orbe, ‘separated from the whole
world!

68-70. ‘Shall Ι ever, on beholding after a long time my native land, and
the tuuf-thatched roof of the humble cottage, my old domain, hereafter see
with wonder a few poor ears of comi’ post (l. 7 ) is adverbial, and a
repetition of lonso post tompore (1. 68). annuos mirabor ιπηι-
‘shall Ι be surprised at the scantiness of the harvest due to the bad farming -
of the soldiersl’ Some editors render post aliquot aristam ‘after a few
summers' comparing Claudian. Quart. Cons. Hon. 372 decimas emensus
aristas. But post aliquos mm in this seuse' would hardly harmonise
with longo post temporo.

71. nova11a=(1) fallow·land; (a) land ploughed for the frrst time ;
(3) cultivated land in general, which is the sense here.

72. babarus, referring to the Gauls, Germans, and other barbarians
who had been talren into the Roman armies.

78. hin, ‘these are they for whom‚' etc.

74. nuno with imperative in ironical sense, as often; cp. Aen. vii. 4²5
inum. ‘Go ou grafting: etc.

77. Μάσκα of goats browsing ou the cliffs: cp. pendentes rupe capellas
Ov. Pont. i. 8. 51.
