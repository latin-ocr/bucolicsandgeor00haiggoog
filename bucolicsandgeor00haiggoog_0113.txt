CORYDON, a shepherd, deplores the indifference of Alexis, his master's
iavourite slave, and his own infatuation. Parts of the Eclogue are modelled
very closely from Theocritus xi, where the Cyclops addresses Galatea: and
Corydonis a mixture of the ordinary Theocritean shepherd and the Cyclops
The date ol the poem is uncertain; but it was earlier than Ecl. v. (see v. 86,

baubat, ‘he knew not what to hope for;’ cp. the use oi dare2‘to tell,¹

latebat, ‘he had nothing to hope sor,' would be consecutive.

8-5. ammius is sometimes taken as acc of respect with dnus,

18. unates, ‘privet3' mosara, ‘bilberry.' Such is the meaning oi
the words in Linnaeus, but they may have had a different meaning ¹iu ancient
times. As Kenn. points out, the identification ol ancient plants is in many
cases a matter oi conjecture. Some suppose motula to have been the
purple hyacinth, and even identify it with ὑάκινθος.
