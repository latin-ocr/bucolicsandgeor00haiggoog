116 BUCOLICA. ECL. ΙΙΙ. 82-110.

Others take it with islo, ‘along samueli· veti mouit, ior the scansion
“ see Introd. p. 18.

82. Momm, sc. a lacte, ‘weaned’

84, 85. C. Asinius Pollio, ffie distinguished poet, orator, and historiau.
.He was a patron os virgil, Horace, and other writers, and was the first

· person to establisha public library at Rome. The vitula (as also the

taurus oi 1. 86) is intended as a sacrifice in honour os Pollio.

86, 87. nova, ‘new,’ ie. original. Some suppose the term to denote
tragedies on Roman subjects, not copied from the Greek. Cp. Ecl. viii. uo
where Pollio’s tragedies are praised. But it is unnecessary to restrict nevo
to this precise meaning. qui petat, consecutive subj.‚ ‘such as butte!

88-91. The general sense is, ‘ May He admirer of Pollio's genius reach
Pollio's emiuence in literature: may he, to speak allegorically, reach the
Arcadian dream-land of poets, where every tree streams honey‚ and every
bush bears spice. But may ffle admirer of Bavius and Maevius try in vain
for poetic fame: may his labour be as much thrown away, as iu yoking
forres to the plough or milking he·goats.’ quo te quoque gaudet (venissel,
‘the point which he rejoices that you have reached? Bauius, fluvius,
all that is known about these persons is that they were inferior poets, and
enemies of Virgil and Horace. One oi Horace's Epodcs (10) is about
Maevius, and consiste oi a prayer ffiat he may be drowued in the course of a
voyage he is making.

96. reice, here a dissyllable. The spelling of the best ages was reicio or
reiecio, not rer'icrb: and so with the other compounds of iccio. See Munro
ou Lucret. i. 34.

98. cogite, i. e. drive to a shady plaee. rampant, ‘shall have already

, dried up.’

102. neque appears to be used amisii, ‘not even:' cp. Cic. Tusc. i. 26
quo nec in deo quidquam maius intelligi potest (quoted by Wagner). .

103. hanimi (the Latin form oi Bouneima-to ‘charm' or ⁸ bewitch,’
here by means of the evil eye.

104, 105. The answer to the riddle is unknown. Various conjectures
are recorded, e. g. that Virgil intended the tomb osone Caelius (by a pun on
eseli), who had lost everything but land enough ior a grave; that he meant
a well, an oven, the shield oi Achilles, etc.

106.107. incompti nomm, ‘with tbe names written on them,’ accus.
alter passive verb iu imitation oi the Greek. See note to Ecl. i. 55. The
flower referred to is the hyacinth, which was said to be inscribed with Al rii,

denoting Ajax, or Υ, denoting Hyacinthus, the favourite oi Apollo.
109,110. ‘You deserve the prize, aud so does he, and so will any one
who shall feel love as you—the alarms oi its enjoyment, the bitterness os
disappointment? This is the general sense of the MS. text. Wagn, Forb.
and Ribb. read in l. 110 haut (ie. haud) . . dicut, with a full stop aster
luto in 109: the words et quisquis . . . amaros then= ‘ he who is not afraid
and backward in love will uot find it bitter.' But no change is necessary.
