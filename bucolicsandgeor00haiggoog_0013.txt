text and upon Latin orthography being omitted as being outside
the scope oi such an edition as this.

In the preparation of the first edition the books principally
used were Professor Conington's standard commentary, eom-
pleted by Professor Nettleship3 the editions of Forbiger,
Gossrau, and Kennedy; Professor Nettleship’s ‘Suggestions
Introductory toa Study of the Aeneid' and Professor Sellafs
volume ‘On the Roman Poets oi the Augustan Age! In
revising the notes the Editors have had the advantage of
consulting Mr. Sidgwick's school edition, from which they
have derived many valuable suggestions. The original Editor
desires also to repeat his special obligation to the Venerable
Edwin Palmer, D.D.‚ Arehdeacon oi Oxford and Canon of
Christ Church‚ formerly Fellow and Tutor of Balliol College3
to whose lectures on Virgil he looks back as the foundation
and stimulus of any Virgilian learning that he possesses, and

by the use of whose MS. notes he was much assisted in
compiling the former edition.
