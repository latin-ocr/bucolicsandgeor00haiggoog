⁴158 oaorem J. 506-513·

506. miro, probably dative. ,

509-511. Euphraten, perhaps alluding to Phraates, who about 32 Β. c.‚ ”
on Antonius withdrawing his forces, overran Media and Armenia. The
allusion in Gamala is uncertain: but it may beto a war of C. Carrinas
against the Morini and Suevi (about 31 Β. o), sor which he was afterwards
allowed a triumph. viarm urbe· must be the neighbour cities of Italy,
and Rara impin· =‘ civil war.' Dion (50. 6), in speaking of the events ⁴
of 3² Β. e., implies that there were cities in Italy which savoured Antonius
and gave Octavianus some trouble to crush them.

513. addunt in mua, ‘throw themselves on to the conrse‚' the reflexive
se being omitted, as osten in poetry. Another rendering is ‘go quicker
every tum,’ addunt being then an imitation of the Greek ἐπιδιδόασι, and in
spatia=srom spatium to spatium (cp. in dies, ‘srom day to day ’). This is
ingenious, but the meaning given to addunt is purely conjectural. The
true reading, however, is uncertain, the MSS. varying between addunt
spatia, addunt spatio, addunt in spatia, addunt in spatio, and addunt se in
spatio.
