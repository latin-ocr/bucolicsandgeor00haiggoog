narnus.

Tms poem was written by Virgil to condole with his friend Cornelius
> Gallus (see note to Ecl. vi. 64) on the faithlessness of his mistress Lycoris
or Cytheris, to whom Gallus had addressed most of his elegies, us Pro·
pertius to Cynthia or Tibullus to Delia. Gallus is represented as dying for
love, receiving visits of syinpathy from rural deities, and singing his hope·
less love-plaint to Arcadian shepherds. The poem is modelled on the
latter part of Thteocritus i. As in Ecloguei the identification of shepherd
and poet leads to some confusion of ideas; Gallus being represented as at
the same time a soldier and a shepherd, in the camp in Italy and under a
rock in Arcadia. The date of the poem is about 38 Μ.. when Agrippa
was leading an expedition into Gaul and across the Rhine‚ with which
Gallus’ rival is supposed to have gone (l. 23).

1. Arcthua, the fountain at Syracuse, was conventionally the pastoral
